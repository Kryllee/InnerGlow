# InnerGlow: Your Expo Mobile App

## 🚀 Get Started

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project, initialized with `create-expo-app`. Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally.

### ⚙️ Installation

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the app:**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

After running the start command, you will be presented with options to open the app:
* In **[Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)**, a limited sandbox for quick testing.
* In a **[development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)** for a more comprehensive test environment.
* On an **[Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)** or **[iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)**.

### 💻 Development

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **`app`** directory. This project uses **[file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction)**, which simplifies navigation by mapping components directly to routes.
